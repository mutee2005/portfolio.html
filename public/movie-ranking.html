    <h2>Meet Joe Black</h2>
    <p>This movie beholds a good square yard of place in my heart because of the blossom it creates between sprituality and romance</p>
    <h2>Don't mess with the Zohan</h2>
    <p>Another marvelous presentation of wit and the persuit of true calling by Adam Sandler</p>
